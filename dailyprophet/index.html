            <p>We get to the bottom of the tragedy</p>
            

            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m almost 20 and haven’t been able to score a better job than a cook at a local fast food joint. What makes it worse is that I live in a small town so business is pretty limited, and where I work is the only place that’ll hire high school graduates. This is the only job I’ve ever had and I will probably never get a better one. My coworker harasses me verbally all day. If I told my boss, he would just cut my already low salary. All that he cares about is money and her fat daughter.<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Outside of work, I don’t do anything. My best friend is mentally retarded, but I suppose that’s better than nothing. I am also in love with one of my few friends. She’s an athletic, smart, gorgeous southern belle who just moved here, but I’m sure she hates me too. My neighbor basically hates everything I do and all he does is praise himself and cry about his bald head.<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I’m stuck in my home town because I never learned to drive. I fail the driver’s license test EVERY DAMN TIME I TAKE IT. Worst of all I live in a darn pineapple under the sea.</p>

            <P>Imagine library filled with every book in the world, none of them have title on cover and the pages are blank, but when You open one You instantly transported to the world within the book. You get to live in the story as any character for as long as You like . And when You come out of the story, almost no time has passed in the real world.</P>
